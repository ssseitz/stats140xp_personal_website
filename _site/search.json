    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract: In crab farming, the ability to tell the age of a given crab is essential in order for farmers to know the ideal time to harvest them. In particular, after attaining a certain age, crabs grow at a negligible rate, so the ability to accurately estimate their age can help to minimize the costs associated with their upkeep and thereby maximize profits. The goal of this report is to estimate the age of crabs based on readily-observable physical attributes. \nIn order to complete this task, analysis was performed using linear regression on the dataset CrabsAgePrediction.csv which was found on Kaggle, uploaded by Gursewak Singh Sidhu. This dataset includes measurements of 3893 mud crabs found in the Boston area. These measurements include age, sex, height, length, diameter, weight, shucked weight, shell weight, and viscera weight. While the original dataset does include the weight of the crabs, this was not used in the analysis as shucked weight, shell weight, and viscera weight add up to equal the total weight. It was found that the model that best predicts the age of the mud crabs in the Boston area uses the shucked weight, shell weight, height, diameter, and an additional variable is.intermediate, which categorizes the sex of the crabs into either “intermediate” or “not intermediate,” in order to predict the logarithm of the Age. This model eliminated variables that were not statistically significant and used a log transformation on the variable Age to reduce the nonlinearity issue it had with other variables. \nFinal Paper"

    "text": "Abstract: The objective of the Kaggle project is to utilize classification models on the provided dataset to predict alcoholic status using a person’s vitals.  The report offers a comprehensive overview of the process of building our final model, encompassing introduction, data imputation, classification methods, hero model, as well as discussions on the limitations and potential improvements of our work.  \nOur hero model is built on neural networks. The following predictors were used in the model: sex, age, waist, DBP, BLDS, HDL_chole, LDL_chole, triglyceride, hemoglobin, urine_protein, serum_creatine, SGOT_AST, SGOT_ALT, gamma_GTP, and Smoking.Status. Achieving a final accuracy score of 0.73120, our model ranked 23rd in the Kaggle competition. \nFinal Report\nKaggle Competition Page"

    "text": "Abstract: In order for the brain to maintain proper functionality, a consistent intake of oxygen is essential as energy production for neural tissues is heavily reliant on oxygen. However, this poses the question of whether different levels of oxygen have any sort of effect on cognitive function or if it does not matter what concentration of oxygen one inhales as long as it is “enough”. Our study aims to determine if different oxygen concentrations seem to have an effect on cognitive functionality as well as if different inhalation periods of this oxygen has any effect. In order to do this, we used a Two-Way Randomized Block design and measured the reading comprehension scores of 198 Islanders directly after inhaling different oxygen percentages (15%, normal, and 40%) for their assigned duration (10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes). We also blocked by gender as previous studies had differing conclusions on if there is a significant difference in reading comprehension between these two genders. Using a significance level of 0.05, we concluded that oxygen concentration was the only significant predictor of reading comprehension score. These results indicate that it may be worthwhile for schools and workplaces to make efforts to maintain proper ventilation in order to maintain optimal mental performance.\nProject Slides\nFinal Paper"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract: This report investigates the impact of COVID-19 lockdown policies on spending, and whether said policies impacted the economic recovery of a city. We chose to focus on New York City, New York, a state that enforced a mandatory lockdown, and Omaha, Nebraska, a state that did not issue any stay-at-home or complete lockdown orders. This report uses data from the Opportunity Insights data tracker, a non-partisan, not-for-profit organization located at Harvard University. In order to conduct this analysis, we created several time series plots and conducted t-tests using our chosen variables. We found that spending overall was significantly different in the two cities — spending in arts and entertainment decreased while grocery spending increased in New York City, and arts spending increased while grocery spending remained unaffected in Omaha. Our t-tests indicate a significant difference as well, with a p-value &lt; 0.05. In conjunction, our t-tests and time series plots both suggest a rejection of the null hypothesis, thus, we conclude that lockdown policies have an impact on spending. However, due to our limiting factors (mainly the confounding variables which occur due to the differences in population, primary industry, and other aspects of the two cities), we are unable to concretely determine the exact impact lockdown policies have. Still, we believe our analysis could result in useful contributions regarding policy decisions, namely the impact that national disasters may have on spending and potential areas of impact to focus on.\nFinal Report\nFinal Poster"
