During my time as an Undergraduate Researcher in the Bianchi Lab at UCLA, I created many models taking advantage of machine learning in order to interpolate chlorophyll data with the ultimate goal of predicting values for Pseudo-nitzchia domoic acid, which is a toxin associated with harmful algal blooms. When enough domoic acid accumulates in shellfish, it can be harm humans as they ingest it.
