**Abstract:** In order for the brain to maintain proper functionality, a consistent intake of oxygen is essential as energy production for neural tissues is heavily reliant on oxygen. However, this poses the question of whether different levels of oxygen have any sort of effect on cognitive function or if it does not matter what concentration of oxygen one inhales as long as it is “enough”. Our study aims to determine if different oxygen concentrations seem to have an effect on cognitive functionality as well as if different inhalation periods of this oxygen has any effect. In order to do this, we used a Two-Way Randomized Block design and measured the reading comprehension scores of 198 Islanders directly after inhaling different oxygen percentages (15%, normal, and 40%) for their assigned duration (10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes). We also blocked by gender as previous studies had differing conclusions on if there is a significant difference in reading comprehension between these two genders. Using a significance level of 0.05, we concluded that oxygen concentration was the only significant predictor of reading comprehension score. These results indicate that it may be worthwhile for schools and workplaces to make efforts to maintain proper ventilation in order to maintain optimal mental performance.
